# Quantum-Measurement-Noise-Simulator
Quantum Measurement &amp; Noise Simulator is an interactive UI-based tool built with Python and Qiskit to visualize quantum measurements, shot-based outcomes, and noise effects. Users can compare ideal and noisy circuits, view histograms, and explore realistic quantum behavior directly in Colab.
