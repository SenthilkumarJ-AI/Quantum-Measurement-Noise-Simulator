Quantum Measurement & Noise Simulator
An interactive UI-based quantum computing simulator built with Python, Qiskit, and IPyWidgets to help users understand how quantum measurement and noise affect real quantum systems.
This project runs directly in Google Colab and requires no code modification—all interaction happens through an intuitive UI.

⚛️ Single-qubit quantum circuit simulation
📊 Measurement probabilities vs shot-based outcomes
🔁 Compare ideal and noisy quantum execution
🧩 Automatic quantum circuit visualization
📈 Measurement histograms
🧠 Noise models (bit-flip & depolarizing)
🧠 Concepts Covered
